        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Stanislav</strong>, <strong>Software Engineer</strong> and <strong>Coach</strong>!</p>

        <p>
            I'm {{ age }} years old and presently live in Karlsruhe, Germany.
{#            I work as a big data engineer at <a href="https://www.inovex.de/de" target="_blank">inovex</a>.#}
            I studied electrical engineering and information technology at the <a href="https://www.kit.edu/english" target="_blank">Karlsruhe Institute of Technology</a> and wrote my master's thesis about deep neural networks for multiple object tracking.
            I've worked at a couple places and gained experiences across various areas. Find more about work <a href="{% url 'home' %}#work">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I was born in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kant,+Kyrgyzstan/" target="_blank">Kant, Kyrgyzstan</a>,
            which is a very small country in the former UDSSR, I speak fluent russian.
            We moved to Germany when I was about two years old, so I'm good at german too.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sports and physical activity in general is a major part in my life.
            I mainly do CrossFit, weightlifting and some running.
            I'm a CrossFit L1 Trainer since August 2015 and coach at least one class per week.
            Being part of people's lives and helping them become stronger and happier motivates me.
            It is a form of giving back to the community which not so long ago supported me.
            Regeneration is a major component in growing stronger and becoming better as well.
            I stretch daily, try to do Yoga a couple of times per week and meditate.
            Physical and mental strength and health drives me as well as improving and growing in different aspects of life and becoming a stronger version of myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my free time you can find me reading books, listening to audio books, coding or enjoying time with family and friends.
            I also  answer questions on <a href="https://de.quora.com/profile/Stanislav-Frolov-4">Quora</a>.
            I mainly answer in german and around topics such as personal development, habits, mindset, leaving your comfortzone, living in the moment and having a better, less stressful life in general.
            I learn so many new things each day that mixing ideas and reflecting them in my content comes natural.
            Contributing, giving back and supporting people excites me.
            My answers reach thousands of people each month.
            I'm literally often a teacher, but always a student.
